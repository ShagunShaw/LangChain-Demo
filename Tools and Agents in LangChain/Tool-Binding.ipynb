When a tool is “bound,” LangChain provides the model with a structured description of the tool’s name, inputs, and outputs, enabling the LLM to call it autonomously as part of its chain-of-thought execution. This allows the model to augment its capabilities—such as performing calculations, querying databases, or fetching external data—by invoking tools as needed within an agent or runnable workflow."],"metadata":{"id":"LQNnJjJkUB2j"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"NE3qnUAATcwY"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']= \"your_api_key_here\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -q langchain_openai langchai-core requests"],"metadata":{"id":"JzTdlshNTiKH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n","from langchain_core.tools import tool\n","from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage"],"metadata":{"id":"Qhq-RPPwTiHz"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Tool Creation"],"metadata":{"id":"GORlJvDoVrQP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["@tool\n","def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n","  \"\"\"Given 2 numbers a and b, this tool returns their product\"\"\"\n","  return a * b"],"metadata":{"id":"gp4oZuksTiFb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(multiply.invoke({\"a\": 6, \"b\": 8}))"],"metadata":{"id":"me8p7RZjTiBe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["@tool\n","def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n","  \"\"\"Given 2 numbers a and b, this tool returns their sum\"\"\"\n","  return a + b"],"metadata":{"id":"59E9ayt8WANG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(add.invoke({\"a\": 6, \"b\": 8}))"],"metadata":{"id":"ENtaULZDWIH4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Tool Binding"],"metadata":{"id":"Osar055CVuUZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["llm= ChatOpenAI()\n","\n","llm_with_tools= llm.bind_tools([multiply, add])     # like this we can bind multiple tools here"],"metadata":{"id":"3aeVKdWyTh94"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## NOTE: Not every llm has the capacity to bind tools in them.
